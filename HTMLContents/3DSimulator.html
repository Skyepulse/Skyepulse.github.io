        <h1>3D ALPHAI Robot Simulator for AI training</h1>
        <div class ='BodyText' id = 'mainText'>
            I was in charge of creating a 3D simulator for Learning Robot's main software AlphAI.
            The simulator was created using Unity3D and C#, and had to be able to reproduce all activities
            done by the AlphAI robots. This simulator can be used to train the neural networks of the robots, and to test
            them with different environments and activities. Activities include: robot racing, intruder detection, path finding, and more.

                    The simulator is a fully interactive tool to personnalize the arenas and therefore the reinforcement training. The user can choose the number and size of obstacles, line following patterns, positions and configurations in different arenas. The arenas are a 1-1 representation of Learning Robot's real learning tools.
