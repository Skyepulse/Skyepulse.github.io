                        <p>
                            Ecolife is a game developed by a team of 6 students using Unity as a school project.
                            In this game you play as a fox that discovers his environment and the many man-made
                            threats that endanger it.

                        <h2>Discover the changes</h2>
                        <p>
                            The impact of the humans are revealed to the player as he progresses through the checkpoints.
                            When hunting, a road will appear making it harder to catch preys, a hunter will also
                            appear to exterminate the foxes, and the forest will burn down with fireplaces.

                        <h2>My contribution</h2>
                        <p>
                            I was on the backend and frontend teams. I worked on the whole fox move set and overall controller feel, as well as the hunter.
                            I also implemented the agents AI system (rabbits, hunters, foxes, etc.) for map movement and interaction.
                            I implemented one of the two mini-games in the game, the hunting mini-game.

                            The game was well received by the students, and we won the prize of
                            best game of the year from our school. We made a presentation stand
                            where people could come and play the game.
